Dynamic system builder for iOS

## What is the purpose of the app?
First, we need to understand systems. Systems are a fundamental tool, one of the most basic tools we have to analyze the world. 
* Political systems
* Businesses
* Organisms
* Information systems
* Software & the internet
* Economy
* Intelligence

This app aims to be the best way to model systems. Of course, it will have to see a lot of iterations to reach this goal.

Let's take a look at systems:

Systems have a purpose (a goal or objective)
Systems can be nested (i.e sub-systems)
Systems are composed of stocks and flows
Systems can have balancing (negative) or reinforcing feedback loops (positive)

Let's take a look at stocks:

Stocks can be any quantity, measured or calculated
The value of a stock falls on a number-line in a dimension of what it's measuring
Larger stocks act as a buffer that gives a system stability and makes it less chaotic

Now, a look at flows:
Flows simply transfer a certain amount from one stock to another
Flows are triggered by events (for example time, the condition of a system, or external input)
Flows can use a conversion if types aren't interchangable (usually ratio-based)

Let's look at feedback loops:

Feedback loops are either balancing or reinforcing
Balancing feedback loops aim to maintain homeostasis of the system
In a system with dominant balancing loops, every change is minimized
Reinforcing feedback loops aim to make a state change of the system
In a system with dominant reinforcing loops, every change is amplified
In a system with dominant reinforcing loops, the loop requires greater resources from preserved stocks
Usually systems have a mix of balancing and reinforcing feedback loops that form a dynamic equilibrium

Finally, let's look at goals:

Goals can be real (i.e value measurements) or stated (text description)
System goals are managed by a meta-system (the user)
Goals are assigned to different stocks by giving an "ideal" value to that stock
Super-system goals take precedence over sub-system goals
The further the measured value is from the ideal value, the more out-of-balance a system is
The more out-of-balance a system, the higher priority/stronger signal the system receives to resolve its imbalance
When subsystem goals are aligned with the super-system goals, the system operates efficiently
Goals can change over time or be updated as necessary
Goals can also be set by the super system via experimentation (what is required to achieve a steady state)
Sometimes a system can have multiple goals that work in-tandem

Let's take a concrete example and see how the concepts apply:

1. Cafeteria:

Goal: serve food to students at lunch time
Goal: every student who wants food at lunch can buy food
Goal: minimize food waste
Goal (4th iteration): maximize food sales and minimize food waste

Units:
* liters
* kilograms

Dimensions: 

* fridge food
* hot food
* money
* employees

Stocks: (amount) (unit) (dimension)

500 kilograms fridge food
30 kilograms hot food
500 money
5 employees

Flows:
* prepare food:
** frigde food -> hot food

sell food:
* hot food -> out
** out -> money

* throw out food
** hot food -> out
